Picspire
===

###### Motivation
Have you ever tried taking the perfect picture in a new place but your pictures are never quite as nice as all these Instagram photographers? Well, Picspire is just for you! Picspire is a camera app that presents you with photography inspiration right from Instagram.

The pictures we pull for you are based on the contents of your viewfinder as well as your location so you can see the best pictures similar to the one you want to capture
